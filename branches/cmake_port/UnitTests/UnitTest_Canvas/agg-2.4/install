Anti-Grain Geometry is a C++ library distributed in sources
and does not require any installation procedure. The source code 
is platform independent and does not have any dependencies on 
system APIs (except for very standard C runtime library).
You just take source files and include them into 
your project. The sources are maintained to be highly compatible
with most popular C++ compilers, including poor ones, like
Microsoft Visual C++ V6.0. 

On Unix/Linux/MacOS/BeOS/AmigaOS systems you can type "make" to 
build src/libagg.a There must be GNU Make utility installed.
Makefiles are very simple, so that if something goes wrong
you could easily fix it. There are no "include files" 
dependency suppoeted.
Also note that there's no "make install" option either;
basically the original Makefiles are needed only to build
the examples. 

After building the library you do "cd examples/<YourOS>" and build 
the examples in a similar way. 

On most Linux platforms the "automake" environment should work.
It's generously provided by Nikolas Zimmermann, aka WildFox,
who is a key developer of KDE and KSVG.
This process will replace the original Makefiles.

On Windows there's no library or a DLL created at all. You just
add source files into your project or create a preoject to build 
a LIB/DLL if you wish. The problem is that it's very tedious to 
maintain building environments for all possible configurations. 
I'm sorry for not automating it, but the compensation is that
AGG compiles fine without any hidden problems, nor the neccesity
to configure.
All examples have building environments for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
(.dsp/.dsw) and they are self-sufficient. The newer versions
of the studio can easily convert the projects.
