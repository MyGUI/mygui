      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="What Is OGRE?" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="OGRE(Object-OrientedGraphicsRenderingEngine)isascene-oriented," />
      <Property2 Key="ListAddString" Value="OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="What can it do?" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Lots of things! See the features page for an up-to-date list of the current features." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Also, take a look at the screenshots page to see for yourself the kinds of eye candy OGRE can pump out." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Is OGRE A Game Engine?" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="No. OGRE can be (and indeed has been) used to make games, but OGRE is deliberately" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="designed to provide just a world-class graphics solution;" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="for other features like sound, networking," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="AI, collision, physics etc, you will need to integrate it with other libraries," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="something several frameworks have done, and we have a collision / physics reference integration library as an example in our distribution." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Why? Well, one reason is that not everyone who needs a 3D engine wants to make games," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="so we don't assume that you do - you can use OGRE for games, simulations, business applications, anything at all." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Secondly, even within the games industry, requirements can vary widely;" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="for example a MMORPG will need a very different kind of network library than an FPS," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="and a flight sim will need a different kind of collision / physics system to fighting game. If OGRE included all these features," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="we would be enforcing a particular set of libraries on you, with an inbuilt set of assumed requirements, and that's not good design. Instead," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="we provide a very integration friendly API and let YOU choose the other libraries, if you want them." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="Many experienced game developers have expressed their approval of this approach, because there are no inbuilt constraints." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="It can be more daunting for newer users who just want to build another FPS-style game," />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="but for those people there are a growing number of existing frameworks using OGRE which provide a complete solution using a given combo of libraries;" />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="but it's important to realise that OGRE itself will always remain separate, flexible enough to be incorporated into any of these." />
      <Property Key="ListAddString" Value="The principle is of collaboration and integration with other libraries, rather than assimilation of them, a standard tenet of component-based design." />
